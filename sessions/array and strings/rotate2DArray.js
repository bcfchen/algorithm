// Rotate a 2 array clockwise by 90 degrees, like rotating the pixels of an image.
// You can assume that this is a square matrix, so the width and the height are the same. 
// Also you need to rotate this in-place by modifying the original array, 
// meaning you cannot create another 2D array to do this
